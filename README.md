# Genetic Algorithms
### Repository containing my little genetic algortihm project I've been messing around with 
I've been fascinated with the history of Earth and life, so I wanted to play around with simulating genetic diversity in populations, and key concepts of evolution and such that are observed in nature

## Included is a makefile to run the test. Included are make, make run, and make clean.
It took me 6,351 generations to run with the current code, still messing around with it in freetime
